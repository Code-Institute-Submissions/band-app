    		<p align="justify">After starting to write songs and play guitar at age 15, it wasn't  long before her talent was noticed locally and she played support to Damien Dempsey near her home in the Millbank Theatre at still just 16 years old. Since then, over the years Liz has played most major venues in Dublin and beyond, in cities such as Paris and Hamburg whilst headlining her own shows back in Dublin in venues such as The Sugar Club and Whelan's.  She has also played support along the way to the likes of Jack L, Iain Archer, Honor Heffernan and Albert Niland among others.

    		<p align="justify">Liz released her first studio album <i>'Til The Day Fades In</i> at the age of 18, shortly after completing her Leaving Certificate in 2005. While studying for her degree in NCAD, Dublin, Liz continued to write, record and develop her own style of music, drawing on the influences of such artists as PJ Harvey, KT Tunstall and Gemma Hayes to create her own unique blend of acoustic alternative folk-rock, as well as heartfelt piano music.  With the release of Turbulent Bliss, Liz aims to become a recognised female singer-songwriter similar to the that of Sheryl Crow and continue to entertain audiences everywhere with her uplifting vocals and exciting live shows.</p>
